# Hydration

### Introduction

- Web applications today need both speed and interactivity.

- Next.js and React use Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG) to pre-render pages.

- However, pre-rendered pages are just static HTML; they lack interactivity.

- Hydration is the process where React "wakes up" the pre-rendered page by attaching event handlers and state.

- Without hydration, buttons, forms, and other UI elements wonâ€™t respond to user interactions.

- Too much hydration can slow down page interactivity and affect user experience.

- Optimizing hydration is crucial for balancing performance and interactivity.
